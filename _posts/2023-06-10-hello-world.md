This is my first official post on this blog thingy. I have thought about doing something like this for years and I actually had a wordpress site for a while but I wanted something that I could update easier with Git. Also I wanted to wait until I have my proper home server set up before I really tackle this. Now I have it, and I will probably do another post about that as well, and I found out this [Chirpy starter template](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) which suits my needs really well. So here we are, almost everything is configured pretty nicely and I have a CI-pipeline up and running. Now it's all about the writing and I have no excuses to postpone it.

The point of this blog is to document different things that I do regarding my coding projects, homelab setups and whatever comes to my mind. This will probably be a tech-oriented blog but if get inspirations to write about something else, there might posts about that as well. Time will tell.
